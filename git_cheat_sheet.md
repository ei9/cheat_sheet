# Git cheat sheet

### Step by step.
- Create a repository on [Github](https://github.com).
- Clone the repository to my computer.
```
git clone <https://github.com/account/repo.git>
```
- Start coding...
- Check out what you've done.
```
git status
```
- Check which lines of codes you've changed.
```
git diff
```
- Add file to check list one by one.
```
git add *file1* *file2*
```
Or add all of them.
```
git add .
```
- Add a note when you finished a portion.
```
git commit -m "What you've done."
```
- Upload to github. They will ask for your account/password.
```
git push
```

### When you have a partner who worked at mid night with a cup of coffee...

- Make sure you update the source code in the morning.
```
git pull
```
